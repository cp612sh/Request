Request is a simple http lib for iOS.  It attempts to match the simplicity of node's request.
It requires XCode 4.5 and uses ARC.  It's really easy to use:

[Request get:@"http://www.google.com" withBlock:^(RequestResponse* response){
    NSLog(@"%@",[response responseDataToString]);
}];

TOOD:
add documentation
add better oauth and http auth support
add cookie jar (a place to keep cookies)
add some real tests :)
